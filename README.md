Final Project: House Price Prediction â€“ Data Science Fundamentals
ðŸ§© Project Scenario
As a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust, I was tasked with exploring and analyzing residential housing data to support the Trustâ€™s new investment initiative. The goal of this project is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more.

Using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, I completed a series of exercises in a Jupyter Notebook to build predictive models and generate insights from real-world housing data.

Dataset Overview
Dataset includes home sales from King County, Washington (including Seattle).

Time period: May 2014 to May 2015.

Features include:

Square footage

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Zip code

Number of floors

House condition and grade

Date of sale

Sale price (target)

Project Objectives
