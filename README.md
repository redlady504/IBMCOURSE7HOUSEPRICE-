Final Project: House Price Prediction – Data Science Fundamentals
🧩 Project Scenario
As a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust, I was tasked with exploring and analyzing residential housing data to support the Trust’s new investment initiative. The goal of this project is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more.

Using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, I completed a series of exercises in a Jupyter Notebook to build predictive models and generate insights from real-world housing data.

🗂️ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes home sale data from King County, Washington (including Seattle), with transactions recorded between May 2014 and May 2015. Key features in the dataset include:

🏠 Square footage

🛏️ Number of bedrooms

🛁 Number of bathrooms

🌲 Zip code

🏗️ Number of floors

🧱 Condition and grade of the home

📅 Date of sale

💲 Sale price (target variable)

📌 Objectives
Understand the structure and summary of the dataset

Handle missing values and perform data preprocessing

Create linear regression models using scikit-learn

Evaluate models using metrics like R² score

Visualize data relationships and regression fits

Apply polynomial regression and regularization techniques

📓 Notebook Tasks
The notebook is structured into ten questions, each targeting a specific skill:

Load and explore the dataset

Data cleaning and type conversion

Summary statistics

Simple linear regression

Multiple linear regression

Model evaluation

Polynomial regression

Pipeline creation

Grid search and cross-validation

Final evaluation and model selection
